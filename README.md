# family-map
Family map is an family history application for Android.

This repo contains the code for both the server and the app.

To run the family-map-server just run the Server.java file in the server module.
It requires a port number to listen on.

Once the server is running you should be able to view the app in an Android emulator.

When a user signs up for the app, 4 generations of family members are generated based on the user's name.
